    "Clinical notes in real-world Electronic Health Records (EHRs) contain a wide variety of symptoms, complaints, and diagnostic clues, but they rarely include a clean, structured diagnosis field. To build a clinically meaningful machine-learning model from the SOAP notes in this dataset, it was necessary to convert the unstructured text into high-level disease categories that a classifier can reliably learn.\n",

    "Initially, we auto-assigned each SOAP note to 10 granular disease categories (respiratory, GI/GU, neurological, cardiac, women’s health, infectious, endocrine, musculoskeletal, pediatrics, general) using medically-informed keyword rules. However, several categories had very low sample sizes (fewer than 50 notes), which would lead to poor model performance, class imbalance issues, and unstable predictions.\n",

    "After evaluating model predictions on the external Option B clinical cases, it became evident that several records were affected by label noise due to overly broad or generic category assignments (particularly cases labeled as “general”). To address this, a clinician-informed relabeling strategy (v2) was introduced, mapping cases into six triage-oriented disease classes: respiratory, GI/GU, neurological, cardiac, musculoskeletal, and general. The v2 rules prioritized clinically dominant organ systems using keyword patterns, corrected major mismatches such as cardiac conditions labeled as general, and ensured gynecologic and hepatobiliary cases were appropriately grouped under GI/GU. This step significantly improved semantic alignment between clinical content and model-intended label structure without retraining the model."

    "Building on v2, a final reviewed labeling framework (v3) was implemented to resolve remaining edge cases and ensure full clinical consistency. This version refined rule priority and expanded musculoskeletal coverage to include orthopedic trauma, hernias, and limb-related vascular conditions (e.g., deep vein thrombosis), reflecting realistic triage workflows in settings where dedicated vascular or surgical classes are unavailable. The v3 framework represents a stable, governance-ready labeling protocol that minimizes label ambiguity, preserves clinical intent, and serves as a reliable reference standard for external validation and future model retraining decisions."
